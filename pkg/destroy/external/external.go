// it. Status is where the provider recorded the identifiers of what it built;
// without it, adoption has nothing to work from.
//
// Finalizers are restored rather than stripped. They were placed by the
// controllers that are about to run again, and a Cluster deleted before its
// controller has re-added its finalizer is removed immediately -- destroy
// then reports success while the whole cloud footprint is still running. The
// cost of restoring them is the opposite failure, a delete that hangs if the
// provider never reconciles, which is loud, bounded by deleteTimeout, and
// confined to a control plane that is thrown away regardless.
