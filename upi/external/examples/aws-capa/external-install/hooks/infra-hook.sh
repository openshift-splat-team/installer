# Reference InfraReady / PostProvision / PreDestroy hook for
# `platform: external` with a Cluster API infrastructure provider.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# On an integrated platform the installer creates the cluster's DNS itself,
# after CAPI reports the network ready. For AWS that is
# pkg/infrastructure/aws/clusterapi/aws.go:112 `InfraReady`, which creates the
# private hosted zone for the cluster domain and the `api` / `api-int` records
# pointing at the API load balancers.
#
# `platform: external` has no such code and must not grow any: the whole point
# is that the installer knows nothing about the provider's cloud. But the
# records still have to exist. A control-plane machine's pointer ignition aims
# at `https://api-int.<clusterDomain>:22623/config/master`, and the bootstrap
# node's own kubeconfig targets `https://api-int.<clusterDomain>:6443`. Without
# the record, bootkube fails at its `resolve-api-int-url` stage and the install
# dies after the full bootstrap timeout.
#
# So the seam is here: the installer calls out to a program the user supplies,
# at the same point in the flow where an integrated provider would run its own
# InfraReady, and hands it everything it can describe without knowing the
# provider's API.
#
# This script is the AWS *reference* implementation of that contract. AWS is
# the reference provider used to exercise the mechanism -- nothing here is
# installer code, and an OCI or other partner would write their own.
#
#
# THE CONTRACT
#
# The installer execs this program directly -- no shell -- with the
# environment below and with whatever arguments the install-config gave it.
# Working directory is the install directory.
#
# Output contract: exit 0 is success and any other exit is failure. On
# failure the installer aborts, and the last few lines this program wrote are
# quoted in the installer's own error, so the last thing said before exiting
# should be the reason. Everything written to stdout and stderr is streamed
# to the installer log as it arrives, prefixed with the hook kind.
#
# Environment is the half of the input the installer owns and every hook
# shares:
#
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_HOOK            "infra-ready", "post-provision" or
#                                     "pre-destroy"
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_INFRA_ID        e.g. mrb-ext10-knzjv
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_CLUSTER_NAME    e.g. mrb-ext10
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_BASE_DOMAIN     e.g. splat.devcluster.openshift.com
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_CLUSTER_DOMAIN  <cluster name>.<base domain>
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_PUBLISH         External | Internal
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_DIR             the install directory
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_MANIFEST_DIR    <install dir>/external-install
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_STATE_DIR       writable; what is recorded here on
#                                     infra-ready is what pre-destroy reads
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_CLUSTER_JSON    the core CAPI Cluster object, as JSON
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_INFRA_JSON      the provider's infrastructure object, as
#                                     JSON, verbatim from the local control
#                                     plane -- unset if there is not exactly
#                                     one
#   OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_KUBECONFIG      the installed cluster's admin
#                                     kubeconfig. Set for every hook and
#                                     usable by none until the cluster's API
#                                     is serving, which at infra-ready it is
#                                     not and at post-provision it is
#
# Arguments are the other half, and are the partner's own: the installer
# passes them through verbatim from
# platform.external.clusterAPI.hooks.<hook>.args and does not read them. This
# script's post-provision half takes
#
#   --input-service <namespace>/<name>   the Service whose load balancer
#                                        address the ingress wildcard must
#                                        point at
#   --input-dns-zone <hostedZoneId>      the public hosted zone for the base
#                                        domain, where the wildcard is
#                                        published
#   --timeout-seconds <n>                how long to wait for that address
#                                        (default 1800)
#
# Flags rather than positional arguments or more environment variables,
# because this file is a script today and may be a compiled binary tomorrow,
# and because `--input-dns-zone Z123` can be copied out of the installer log
# and rerun by hand. The same three flags would be the binary's flags.
#
# Two of the environment entries deserve comment.
#
# OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_INFRA_JSON is the whole mechanism. The installer cannot
# read `status.networkStatus.apiServerElb.dnsName` off an AWSCluster, because
# it has no AWSCluster type and must not acquire one. It can copy the object
# out of its local control plane as JSON and let the hook dig. Every field this
# script reads below is CAPA's schema, not the installer's.
#
# OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_STATE_DIR is how destroy stays honest. Anything created
# here is outside CAPI's ownership, so nothing else will ever clean it up. The
# rule on this pilot is that each new resource ships with its teardown in the
# same change, and the state file is the link between the two directions.
#
#
# THE INGRESS WILDCARD, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN INFRA-READY
#
# `*.apps` cannot be created at infra-ready, and the reason is structural
# rather than a matter of ordering. At infra-ready nothing exists but what the
# infrastructure provider built, and on this platform the provider does not
# build an ingress load balancer for anyone.
#
# It cannot: CAPA's `reconcileLBAttachment` returns early for anything that is
# not a control-plane machine
# (cluster-api-provider-aws/controllers/awsmachine_controller.go:1040-1043) and
# registration adds a machine to *every* target group on the load balancer
# (pkg/cloud/services/elb/loadbalancer.go:1044-1056), so
# `controlPlaneLoadBalancer.additionalListeners` on 80/443 would register
# control-plane nodes into the ingress target groups and never a worker --
# worse than doing nothing. The field is named for and scoped to the control
# plane load balancer and it means it. This is not an argument against the
# field: ../cluster.yaml uses it correctly for port 22623, because the Machine
# Config Server runs on the control-plane nodes, which is exactly the set CAPA
# registers. It works for any control-plane-hosted service and fails for any
# worker-hosted one, and routers are worker-hosted.
#
# Nor does the ingress operator ask for one. On `platform: external` it selects
# `endpointPublishingStrategy.type: HostNetwork` -- verified on mrb-ext11 --
# so the routers bind 80 and 443 on the nodes and the only Service the operator
# creates is a ClusterIP.
#
# So the cluster asks for its own, and the only thing on this platform that can
# answer is the cloud controller manager the partner already had to supply.
# `../extra-manifests/99_external-03-ingress-nlb.yaml` is a
# `Service type=LoadBalancer` that the installer delivers as a day-0 manifest;
# the partner's CCM reconciles it into a real load balancer some minutes into
# bootstrap, and the address it gets is assigned then, at runtime, by the
# cloud. Nothing at infra-ready could have known it.
#
# post-provision is where it is knowable. It runs after the control-plane
# machines exist and before the installer waits for bootstrap to complete, so
# this half waits for that Service to be given an address and publishes the
# wildcard. Waiting here does not deadlock: the operators that need `*.apps`
# are authentication and console, and neither is required for bootstrap to
# complete.
#
#
# WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT DO
#
# Nothing here creates the Service. The installer delivers the manifest and
# the cluster applies it; this hook only reads the address the cluster's own
# CCM put on it. If no CCM is delivered, the Service stays Pending, this hook
# times out and says so, and that is the correct outcome -- the wildcard would
# otherwise point at nothing.
