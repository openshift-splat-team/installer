# Script to test create installer command versioning with template files.
# Make sure you already have extracted CAPI by running:
# $ ./openshift-install extract cluster-api aws --dest-dir=/tmp/capa-artifacts
#
# This runs in two phases. `create manifests` first, so the infrastructure ID
# becomes readable, then the CAPI manifests under external-install/ are
# rewritten to use it, then `create cluster`. The reason is in
# external-install/machines/README.md: Machine.spec.bootstrap.dataSecretName
# must be "<infraID>-bootstrap", the installer picks that name itself, and the
# infrastructure ID does not exist until asset resolution has run.
#
# Editing between the two commands is safe because external-install/ is not an
# asset load path.
#
# Usage: run-create-command.sh <version> [infra-only]
#   infra-only   stop at Cluster.status.infrastructureReady, creating no
#                machines. This is what every run before the bootstrap
#                increment did.
