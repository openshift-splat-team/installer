# # STATUS: EXECUTED, through to a complete cluster, over thirteen runs       #
# # between 2026-09-30 and 2026-10-01. Every correction those runs produced   #
# # is in this file and in external-install/.                                 #
# #                                                                           #
# # One caveat, and it is the important one: the run that produced a complete #
# # cluster needed hand-work partway through -- see the Phase 4 table in      #
# # ../README.md for exactly what and why. The fixes for all but one of those #
# # items are in this file set, and no run has yet been spent proving the     #
# # corrected set installs unattended. Treat an unattended run as untested.   #
# # The one item that is NOT fixed is worker CSR approval, which has no       #
# # machine-approver on `platform: external`.                                 #

#
# THREE PHASES, NOT TWO
#
# The AWS version of this script runs `create manifests`, substitutes the
# infrastructure ID, then `create cluster`. Two phases are enough there because
# CAPA uploads the oversized bootstrap ignition to S3 itself.
#
# CAPOCI cannot: it has no object-store offload of any kind -- no
# object-storage field in api/v1beta2/, no objectstorage client under
# cloud/services/ -- and OCI caps all instance metadata at 32,000 bytes, which
# the bootstrap ignition exceeds by two orders of magnitude.
#
# So a third phase sits between `create ignition-configs` and `create cluster`:
# upload bootstrap.ign, mint a pre-authenticated request over it, and replace
# the file on disk with a pointer config. The installer reloads it, because
# bootstrap.Bootstrap implements Load()
# (pkg/asset/ignition/bootstrap/bootstrap.go:39-41) and is in the
# IgnitionConfigs target (pkg/asset/targets/targets.go:56-64). No installer
# change -- see ../docs/ignition-delivery.md.
#
#   phase 1  create manifests        -> the infrastructure ID exists
#   phase 2  create ignition-configs -> bootstrap.ign exists, oversized
#   phase 3  create cluster          -> reads the stub this script wrote
#
#
# WHAT YOU NEED BEFORE THIS WILL RUN
#
#   oci, jq, python3 on PATH; ~/.oci/config configured
#   OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID       target compartment OCID
#   OCI_REGION               e.g. us-ashburn-1
#   OCI_IMAGE_ID             the RHCOS custom image OCID. NOTHING PROVIDES THIS
#                            YET -- see ../docs/boot-image.md. This is the one
#                            prerequisite that is not merely unconfigured but
#                            unsolved.
#   OCI_IGNITION_BUCKET      a private bucket for the bootstrap ignition
#   OCI_CREDENTIALS_FILE     a YAML Secret for CAPOCI's OCIClusterIdentity,
#                            outside this workspace. Never read by this script
#                            beyond handing its path to `oc apply`.
#   PULL_SECRET_FILE         default ~/.oci/pull-secret.json
#   CAPOCI_ARTIFACTS         default /tmp/capoci-artifacts, holding
#                            capoci-shim.sh, the cluster-api-provider-oci
#                            binary and oci-infrastructure-components.yaml
